# üìù Sprint 1 Retrospective Report

**Project:** ClubHub  
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Sprint Duration:** 2 Weeks  
**Sprint Goal:** Establish project structure, set up environment (React + Express + MongoDB), implement basic Event Management System UI, and initial database schema.

## ‚úÖ What Went Well

- The user interface for students (User Page) was successfully completed and fully functional.  
- AI tools (v0 AI, Figma) accelerated the UI/UX design process, saving significant development time.  
- Frontend‚Äìbackend integration worked smoothly for event browsing and registration.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Didn‚Äôt Go Well

### 1. Major Merge Conflicts
**Issue:** The team experienced significant merge conflicts when integrating code changes, mainly due to multiple developers working in isolation on shared files.  
**Impact:**
- Development time was lost resolving conflicts instead of building features  
- Risk of introducing bugs or losing work during conflict resolution  
- Team frustration and decreased morale  
- Delayed integration of Event Management System components (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3)

### 2. Vague Trello Task Definitions
**Issue:** Tasks in Trello were insufficiently detailed and lacked clear acceptance criteria, making it difficult to track progress and understand what ‚Äúdone‚Äù meant.  
**Impact:**
- Uncertainty about task ownership and responsibilities  
- Difficulty estimating time and effort required  
- Incomplete implementations due to unclear requirements  
- Team members needed extra clarification before picking up tasks  
- The project manager struggled to assess sprint progress accurately

## üîß What Could We Improve

### 1. Break Down the ‚ÄúEvent Management‚Äù Task
- Decompose each user story into technical subtasks (2‚Äì4 hours each).  
- Include specific acceptance criteria for each subtask.  
- Define technical dependencies and integration points.  
- Assign clear ownership to individual developers.  
**Benefit:** Clearer task ownership and measurable progress.

### 2. Git Pull from Main Before Branching
All developers must always run `git pull origin main` before creating a new feature branch.  
**Benefit:** Reduces merge conflicts and ensures everyone works on the latest codebase.

### 3. Implement Formal Pull Request (PR) Process
- No direct commits to `main`.  
- All PRs must be reviewed by at least one team member before merging.  
**Benefit:** Improved code quality and early detection of issues.

### 4. Refine Trello Task Descriptions
- Use ‚ÄúDefinition of Done‚Äù and assign clear owners.  
- Include links to related documents (UI designs, API specs).  
**Benefit:** Faster problem resolution and better team alignment.
